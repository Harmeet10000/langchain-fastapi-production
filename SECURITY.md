# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public GitHub issue

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities privately by:

- Emailing us at [harmeetsinghfbd@gmail.com]
- Using GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature

### 2. Include the following information

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (if available)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Varies based on severity (1-30 days)

## Security Measures

### Code Analysis

This project uses **Codacy** for automated security analysis and code quality monitoring:

- **Static Analysis**: Automated scanning for security vulnerabilities
- **Code Quality**: Continuous monitoring of code patterns and potential issues
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular checks for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Security Hotspots**: Identification of security-sensitive code areas

### Security Best Practices

Our codebase follows these security practices:

#### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication with secure token handling
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

#### Data Protection

- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- SQL injection prevention via SQLAlchemy ORM

#### API Security

- CORS properly configured
- Security headers implemented
- Request validation with Pydantic models
- Proper error handling without information leakage

#### Infrastructure Security

- Docker containers with non-root users
- Regular dependency updates
- Secure database connections
- TLS/SSL encryption in production

### Dependencies

We regularly monitor and update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities
pip-audit

# Update dependencies
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### Security Headers

The application implements the following security headers:

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'`

### Environment Security

#### Development

- Use `.env` files for local configuration
- Never commit sensitive data to version control
- Use different API keys for development and production

#### Production

- Environment variables managed through secure deployment platforms
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Monitoring and alerting for suspicious activities
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures

## Security Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] All dependencies are up to date
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] HTTPS enabled with valid certificates
- [ ] Database connections encrypted
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Logging and monitoring in place

## Third-Party Security Tools

In addition to Codacy, we recommend using:

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Automated vulnerability alerts
- **Snyk**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **OWASP ZAP**: Web application security testing
- **Bandit**: Python security linter
